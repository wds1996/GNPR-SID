The full codebase is still under organization. Currently, we have uploaded:

- The core implementation of the **RQ-VAE** module
- A sample dataset based on **NYC** data
- The data preprocessing notebook: [`dataprocess.ipynb`](./path/to/dataprocess.ipynb) and [`data2json.ipynb`](./path/to/data2json.ipynb) 

For model fine-tuning, we use the [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory).  
You can perform fine-tuning and evaluation by following the official instructions and using the provided dataset.
